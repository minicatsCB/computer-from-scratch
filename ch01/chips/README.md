# Instructions
Example: if you want to create a NOT chip, create a file named `not_chip.vhdl`.

Next, create tests for that chip in a file named `not_chip_tb.vhdl`.

Finally, execute the simulation running the Bash script `start.sh`. If all is correct, GTKWave will open. Don't expect to see some console output like Jest. Just open the waves and check with your eyes if the outputs are correct.
